## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```
   python yt_dlp_webui.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the console (typically `http://127.0.0.1:7860`).

3. Enter a YouTube URL and customize your download settings as needed.

4. Click "Download Video" to start the download process.

## Configuration

- **Proxy Settings**: Enter your proxy URL in the "Proxy Settings" field and click "Update Proxy".
- **Video Format**: Customize the video format string (default: `bestvideo[height<=1080]+bestaudio/best[height<=1080]`)
- **Output Template**: Modify the output filename template (default: `%(id)s-%(title)s.%(ext)s`)
- **Extra Parameters**: Add any additional yt-dlp command-line parameters as needed

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Output Directory
You can specify a custom output directory for your downloads. Simply enter the desired subdirectory name in the "Save Directory" field. The videos will be saved in a subdirectory of the base video directory.

### Format Selection
For advanced users, you can fine-tune your video format selection using yt-dlp format strings. For example:
- `bestvideo[height<=720]+bestaudio/best[height<=720]`: Best quality video up to 720p
- `worstvideo+worstaudio/worst`: Lowest quality available (useful for testing)

### Troubleshooting Downloads
If you encounter issues with a download, try the following:
1. Update the proxy settings if you're behind a firewall
2. Use the "Get Video Info" feature to check available formats
3. Try adding `--force-ipv4` to the Extra Parameters if you're having network issues
